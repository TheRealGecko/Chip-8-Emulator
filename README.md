# Chip-8-Emulator

Made a Chip-8 "emulator" using C++. It emulates the following components:
- Display
- Stack
- Registers
- Oppcode instructions
- Keypad

## What is Chip-8?
Chip-8 was an "interpreted programming language" for 8-bit computers in the mid 1970s. Because the process of writing an interpretor for it is so similar to the process for writing emulators in general, I figured this would be a great way to try out emu-dev!

*Note: I programmed the emulator, not the ROM/game files. The ROM files can be found here ([source](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms/tree/master/games))!*

 To-do:
 - Settings to customize input buttons
 - Add sound emulation
